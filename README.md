# confsync

Confsync is a command-line tool that grabs config files and stores them in a local repository.  It's written in Rust because Rust is cool.

## Requirements

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `cargo build --release`.
3. Profit (by never losing configs again).

## Usage
- **Add** files you want to track.
- **Back up** to capture changes.
- **Restore** time-travel magic.
- [`ARCH.md`](ARCH.md) for the command list.
