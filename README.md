# confsync

 A is a command-line tool that grabs config files, backs them up with Git, and keeps them safe in one place. Written in Rust, because, well... Rust is cool.

## Requirements
- **Rust** (stable)
- **Git** (installed and on your PATH)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `cargo build --release`.
3. Profit (by never losing configs again).

## Usage
- **Add** files you want to track.
- **Back up** to capture changes.
- **Restore** time-travel magic.
- **Git** commands are forwarded.
- [`ARCH.md`](ARCH.md) for the command list.
